## FAQ
-  **Q: Can i host this locally?**
    -  A: Yes, but the file is so large and the login system would not work because the database for logins is online. it is reccomended you use it online, but if you need it offline then go to our golollipop offline version

- **Q: Does the development team have my passwords?**
    - A: No. the passwords are encrypted before it gets stored so we do not know your passwords
      
- **Q: Can a hacker go into the database and get my password?**
    - A: most likely not, we are thinking of hosting this website somewhere safe, and also the passwords are encrypted so nobody can figure them out.
